# RPi-Quadcopter
A Quadcopter controlled by a Raspberry Pi and a PS3 controller

I started this project to participate in an event at ISU called HackISU. My goal was to use things that I already had, such as the RPI, PS3 controller,MYO armband, etc. I didn't want to buy a whole bunch of expensive stuff just for this project. I did have to buy ESC's and brushless motors along with a battery to power them.

Problems I ran into:
  Connecting the PS3 controller to the RPi -- Solved
  Connecting the MYO to the RPi -- Solved
  Using the MYO inputs -- Not Solved Yet
  Calibrating the ESC's -- Not solved Yet
    -For some reason the Motor only responds to the right joystick going down.
    -May be problem with the code. Still looking into it.
